% dx: Returns the time derivatives of the state variables, x-dot.

% Separate the control effort variables to make it easier for the user
% to type in the equations

% Define the system here:

%  Academic first order

% Append zeros for the inputs so vector lengths match
for i=1:num_inputs
   dx(num_states+i,:)= zeros(size(x(2,:)));
